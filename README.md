# XSANS React Component Library

XSANS is a beautifully crafted React component library, built with Tailwind CSS, to help developers quickly build sleek and modern UIs. The library provides reusable components such as buttons, inputs, progress bars, and more, with built-in flexibility and customization options.

## Features

- **Customizable Components:** Easily customizable with Tailwind CSS classes.
- **Simple Integration:** Quickly add components to your project using our CLI tool.
- **Reusable UI Elements:** A growing list of reusable, responsive, and accessible components.

## Installation

You can install components individually using our `npx xsans` CLI tool.

### Install a Specific Component

To install a specific component (e.g., `XButton`), use the following command:

\`\`\`bash
npx xsans add xbutton
\`\`\`

This will install the required files and dependencies for the selected component.

### Install All Components

To install the entire XSANS component library, you can run:

\`\`\`bash
npx xsans add all
\`\`\`

This will install all available components under \`src/xcomponents\` in your project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the XSANS components, make sure your project is set up with Tailwind CSS. If Tailwind CSS is not yet installed, follow the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use a component from XSANS:

1. After running the installation command, import the desired component in your React project.

\`\`\`jsx
import XButton from '@xsans/xbutton';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <XButton>Click Me</XButton>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
\`\`\`

2. Tailwind CSS will automatically apply styles to XSANS components based on your project's configuration. You can further customize these components using additional Tailwind classes if needed.

\`\`\`jsx
<XButton className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700">Submit</XButton>
\`\`\`

### Available Components

- **XButton:** Customizable button component with Tailwind CSS styling.
- **XInput:** Beautiful and accessible input field for forms.
- **XProgress:** A responsive progress bar component.

## Available Scripts

After installing components, you can run the following scripts in your project:

### \`npm start\`

Runs the app in development mode.\\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### \`npm run build\`

Builds the app for production, including all installed XSANS components. The build will be optimized for best performance and ready for deployment.

## Customization

XSANS components are designed to be flexible. You can easily customize the components by extending or overriding the default Tailwind CSS classes.

### Example:

\`\`\`jsx
<XButton className="bg-green-500 text-white rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  Custom Button
</XButton>
\`\`\`
